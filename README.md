Good luck!

**This repo is Read-Only!!** So please don't try to open a pull request

## Set up the environment

Once forked and cloned, set-up the solution as follows:

1. Open the solution with your favourite IDE (we have used and tested using VS Code)
2. Run npm install to make sure you have all the dependencies set up
3. Run `ng serve -o` and make sure the app is running.

The Angular application depends on a separate .net Core API, you will need this running on your development environment to complete assesment's tasks. To provision the API, please:

1. Clone (or fork and clone) the repo https://github.com/Synetec/synetec-interview-test-net-core-api locally
2. Build the solution
3. Run the Synetec.CityInfo.Api project to host the API

## Tasks to be completed

Please complete as many as possible of the tasks listed below

1. The html for the cities list is static. Link it to the list of cities from the component
2. The cities list is empty though the table is still displayed, find a way to display a message to the user when there is no city to display
3. The backend engineers have developed an API that provides you with a list of cities, implement the method in the service that will get all the cities and fetch the result in the cities list of the component
4. The delete button doesn't do anything, implement that feature
